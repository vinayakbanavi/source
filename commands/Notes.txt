 
Commands in java
	1. java
	2. javac  : c - compile
	3. javap  : p - parse
	4. javadoc
	5. jar    : java archive

javap : 
   In order to parse members of any class files
   syntax --> javap java.lang.System
   	      javap java.util.ArrayList

javadoc :
   In order to generate java documentation class must be public
   syntax --> javadoc -d ../docs A.java

jar     : 
   used to develop a jar file
   jar and zip are almost similar.
    
   Need of jar :
   	After completion of Project 
	Generting jar file with all the class files 
	pushing this jar file to the client
	
   syntax --> jar cf ../lib/abc.jar *
   	cf - creating file 
	* - every member in the current directory
	. - current directory
	.. - parent directory

classPath - 
	Using one application content in another application.
	is java specific used for specifying files location to javac and java command
	
	while compiling we mustspecify the location of the class we are using in our project
	syntax >javac -d ../classes -classpath F:\pack1\app1\classes A.java

	while running the java command with classpath,
	syntax >java -classpath F:\pack1\app1\classes 
	java command will look for both A and B in the classpath itself while A is present in the current directory itself
	so we need to specify current directory also
	java command will be having two location where class files are available
	syntax >java -classpath F:\pack1\app1\classes;. A


	set classpath for the current command promt window
	set classpath=D:\november-batch-dev\commands\lib\abc.jar;. 

	or we can set classpath for the current user in my pc
	go to settings/about/advancedSystemSettings/advanced/environmentvariables/user/new/
	Variable name - classpath
	Variable value - url of commands location/ jarlocation


command line arguments : all the arguments must be supplied befor program executing in command line

Scanner class : used to supply data dynamically while program is executing

if any class is from lang package we need to import explicitly all the files will be imported by default
if class is in any other package we need to import explicitly
