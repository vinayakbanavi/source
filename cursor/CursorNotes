n Cursors : 
	Are used to iterate over the Given Collection 
	
	Most commonly used builtIn Cursors :
	All are Interfaces available in java.util package
	All these Cursors acts as a pointer to the actual Collection while in operation
	
	1. Enumeration.
		- 1.0 version of the cursor
		- Only provide read function (only once in forward direction)
		- Allows Concurrent modifications
		
	    drawbacks : 
	    - no function of remove, update, add
		- Only legacy classes provide implementation to the enumeration.
		- Legacy classes are the classes which were in use before collection framework
		  Those are Properties, Dictionary, Stack, HashTable, Vector
		- these classes return implemented object for enumeration through 
		- function : elements();
		
		Enumeration functions :
		- hasMoreElements()
		- nextElement()
		
	2. Iterator. 
		- 2.0 version of the cursor
		- it is successor of the Enumeration
		- Provides some Extra function which was absent in Enumeration.
		- provides Read (only once in forward direction)
		  		   Remove()
		- FailFastIterator : Concurrent modifications are not allowed
		
		drawbacks :
		- Multiple read is not available
		- Update function is not available
		- add Function is not available
		
		Iterator functions : 
		- hasNext()
		- next()
		
	3. ListIterator.
		- 3.0 version of cursor
		- Successor of Iterator
		- Provisions for all CRUD operations
		- Read is available in both the direction (backward read follows only if forward read is done)
		- FailFastIterator 
		
		Iterator Functions :
		- add("element") add as the fist Element after completion of the operation
		- set("element") updates the current referring element or specific element 
		- remove() deletes the specific element
		- it.hasNext(), it.next()
		- it.hasPrevious(), it.previous()
