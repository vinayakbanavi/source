ArrayList implements List extends Collection extends Iterable

1. ArrayList internally using Array to manage elements
   In array series of memory is allocated. in the form of index. 
   so fixed capacity must be specified before creating an array
   
  ----> time and space complexity. 
  		Read  			 : O(1)
			   			 : Random access is very quick since all the elements stored in the series of memory.
				 
	    Insert & remove  : O(n)
	    	           	 : If any collection is using array internally, insert operation and remove operation is not effective.
