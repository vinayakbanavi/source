					Enum (Enumeration)

        - A special class containing group of constants
        - Enums are internally implemented by class
        - constants acts as a reference variable to the instance of that class
        - each constants will be final static Enum class Type having object 
        
        - Enum can have constructor, fields , methods just like other classes
        - Enum cannot inherit other classes or get inherited
        - But they can implement interfaces
	
		- Necessity of enums
		- When we want to store certain constants whose data will not be changed we can use  enums
		- we can define our own data type
		
		- enums can be declared outside a class and also inside class
		- when used outside we cant declare private
		- we can declare private when used inside a class
		- they can be final/abstract
				
	    for example : 
		1. 4 suits in a deck of playing cards
		2. planets
		3. days of week
		4. colors 
		5. directions
		6. Months
